# FedMir - Fedora Package Mirror
#
# This container builds an HTTP Package Mirror for fedora package repositories.
# It builds a package repository with the selected set of packages, the
# specified target release version, as well as the specified architecture. It
# then uses the official `httpd` container to serve this repository via HTTP.
#
# Arguments:
#
#   * FEDMIR_ARCH="x86_64"
#       This controls the architecture of the packages to fetch.
#
#   * FEDMIR_BUILD="docker.io/library/fedora:latest"
#       This controls the build-container used to fetch fedora packages and
#       setup the package repository. By default, it uses the latest stable
#       release of the official fedora containers.
#
#   * FEDMIR_HOST="docker.io/library/httpd:2.4"
#       This controls the host-container used to serve the fedora package
#       mirror.
#
#   * FEDMIR_PACKAGES="base emacs vim"
#       Specify the packages to include in the mirror. Separate packages by
#       space. All their dependencies will be included in the mirror.
#
#   * FEDMIR_RELEASE="rawhide"
#       This controls the Fedora release used as base for this mirror. The
#       packages will be fetched from the official Fedora repositories of the
#       specified release.
